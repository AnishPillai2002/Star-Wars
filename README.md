# Star-Wars


## Description
This is a Star Wars-themed webpage created with HTML and CSS. The webpage features various sections of a poem introducing the Star-Wars universe,a character showcase, and a footer section.

## Parallax Effect
The webpage utilizes the parallax effect to create an illusion of movement. Parallax is a visual effect where the background image moves slower than the foreground image, creating a sense of depth and immersion. In this webpage, the parallax effect is achieved by having single layers of image.

To create the parallax effect, the webpage uses CSS properties such as background-attachment: fixed and background-position: center. The background-attachment: fixed property ensures that the background image stays fixed in place while the foreground content scrolls. The background-position: center property centers the background image on the screen.


## How to View the Webpage
